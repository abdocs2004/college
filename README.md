a **College Management System** designed to efficiently manage departments, instructors, and students! ðŸŽ“ðŸ’»

Key features include:
- Managing **department** details (location, name, head).
- Handling **instructor** information (ID, name, phone, department).
- Maintaining **student** records (ID, name, phone).
- Secure role-based access via a **Login Form** (Department, Instructor, Student) with **authentication** to protect the database.

How I built it:
1. **Database Design**: Developed an **ERD** and **Schema** for optimized data relationships.
2. **SQL Database**: Created a secure SQL database with authentication to restrict access and ensure data safety.
3. **Java & NetBeans**: Built the app using **Java** on **NetBeans**, leveraging **JFrame** for the GUI and **AWT Action Listeners** for interactivity.
4. **JDBC Integration**: Connected the Java app to the SQL database using **JDBC** for seamless CRUD operations.
5. **UML Diagrams**: Designed **UML** diagrams to plan and visualize the system architecture.

This project is a crucial step toward mastering large-scale systems, equipping me to design secure, user-friendly databases for complex applications. ðŸš€
